# VTK-OBJ Converter
After careful online research, there seems to be too much confusion about how to transform a 3D Mesh object in VTK format into an OBJ wavefront format in Python. For this reason, in this repository I present my solution based on the well-known [https://docs.pyvista.org/](pyvista package).

In detail, I took the model of a reconstructed liver kindly provided by [https://opencas.webarchiv.kit.edu/?q=node/14](Suwelack et al.) and I converted their VTK files in OBJ wavefront meshes.
